The pwrtelegram API creator reserves the right to delete any illegal or copyrighted material that is found on his servers.  \r\n\r\n* The PWRTelegram API does not store in any way your bot's token but it does store the bot's username, the sha256 sum of uploaded files and the file ID and the size of uploaded and downloaded files.\r\n\r\n* This API won't be able to send big files if getUpdate or webhook requests aren't proxied through it. This is because when the API uploads these files using tg-cli it must obtain a file_id using the official bot API, and that can be done only by intercepting the incoming update with the file.\r\n\r\n* The methods used by the PWRTelegram API are the same ones used in the official telegram bot API, but they also have some additional features and in certain cases their behaviour is slightly modified (don't worry, that won't break your clients). There are also some methods that work only with the PWRTelegram API. Here's a list:\r\n\r\n* With this API you can use usernames to interact even with normal users and you can get info about bots using their username (with the getChat method).  \r\n\r\n* getUpdates and webhook requests.\r\n\r\nThe response of these requests will be passed trough a piece of code that will filter out messages from @pwrtelegramapi.\r\n\r\n* getFile requests.\r\n\r\ngetFile requests are intercepted and the file is downloaded using the PWRTelegram API.  \r\nThe PWRTelegram API will then return a [File](https://core.telegram.org/bots/API#file) object.   \r\nYou can use the following anonymous url to download the file: ```https://storage.pwrtelegram.xyz/<file_path>``` (or ```https://deepstorage.pwrtelegram.xyz/<file_path>``` for deep telegram bots).\r\n\r\nThe anonymous download URL will be in one of the following formats:  \r\n```\r\nhttps://storage.pwrtelegram.xyz/botusername/filename.ext\r\nhttps://deepstorage.pwrtelegram.xyz/botusername/filename.ext\r\n```  \r\nThis way you will be able to safely share the download URL without exposing your bot's token.  \r\n\r\nYou can also trigger the caching of files already present on the telegram servers to the anonymous PWRTelegram storage server by downloading the file from the following URL: ```https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/file/bot<token>/<file_path>``` (or ```https://deepapi.pwrtelegram.xyz/file/bot<token>/<file_path>``` for deep telegram bots). The next time you can download files directly from the anonymous URL.  \r\n\r\nIf your request times out and you try to redownload the file you will be returned a json array with the following values:\r\n\r\n  * ok => true\r\n\r\n  * error_code => 202\r\n\r\n  * description => Your file is being downloaded. Please try again later.\r\n\r\nYou can repeat the request until you get the File object.  \r\n\r\n * sendDocument, sendPhoto, sendVideo, sendAudio, sendVoice, sendSticker requests.  \r\n\r\nAll of the above requests will be processed using the PWRTelegram API.  \r\n\r\nThe usage of these methods is exactly the same as in the official Telegram BOT API, except that if the request contains a file URL instead of the document (or photo, etc) the file will be downloaded and sent with the given parameters.\r\n\r\nThe same will happen if you send a file ID that links to a file which type is different from the one specified in the URL or if you also provide a file name along with the file ID.\r\n\r\nThe PWRTelegram API will automagically obtain the metadata of the provided file/URL and send it along with the file itself (only if it isn't already present in the request).\r\n\r\nThis is the metadata that will be obtained and sent: \r\n\r\n* Documents: file name as caption\r\n\r\n* Photos: file name as caption\r\n\r\n* Video: file name, width, height and duration as caption, width, height and duration\r\n\r\n* Audio: track name, author, duration as title, author, duration\r\n\r\n* Voice: duration as duration  \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also provide a ```file_name``` parameter containing the name of the file to be sent (this is useful when sending files from a URL). If this parameter is set the PWRTelegram API will rename the file/URL you sent and resend the file with the new file name.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* sendFile\r\n\r\nUse this method to send any file/URL/file ID. This method will automagically recognize the type of file/URL uploaded and send it using the correct telegram method. It will also automagically read file metadata and attach it to the request (only if it isn't already provided in the request). On success, the sent Message is returned.\r\n\r\nThis is the metadata that will be obtained and sent (only if not present in the request) along with the file:\r\n\r\n* Documents: file name as caption\r\n\r\n* Photos: file name as caption\r\n\r\n* Video: file name, width, height and duration as caption, width, height and duration\r\n\r\n* Audio: track name, author, duration as title, author, duration\r\n\r\n* Voice: duration as duration\r\n\r\n| Parameters           \t| Type                                                                           \t| Required \t| Description                                                                                                                                                                  \t|\r\n|----------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|----------\t|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| chat_id              \t| Integer or String                                                              \t| Yes      \t| Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel, group or user (in the format @username)                                                                     \t|\r\n| message_id           \t| Integer                                                                        \t| Yes      \t| Unique identifier of the sent message                                                                                                                                        \t|\r\n| file                 \t| String                                                                         \t| Yes      \t| File to send.

Their usage is exactly the same as for their sendMethod counterparts, except that the chat_id, disable_notification, reply_to_message_id, reply_markup parameters will be ignored.  \r\n\r\nOn success, they will return a json array containing the following elements:\r\n\r\n* ok => true\r\n\r\n* result =>\r\n\r\n * file_id => Uploaded file id\r\n\r\n * file_type => Uploaded file type\r\n\r\n * file_size => Uploaded file size\r\n\r\n * caption => Optional caption of uploaded file id (to send when calling a send method).\r\n\r\nOtherwise the error is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n* deleteMessage\r\n\r\nUse this method to delete text messages sent by the bot or via the bot (for inline bots).  \r\nOn success, if the message is deleted by the bot, a json array is returned with the following values:\r\n\r\n* ok => true\r\n\r\n* result => \"The message was deleted successfully.\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise the error is returned.\r\n\r\n| Parameters        \t| Type              \t| Required             \t| Description                                                                                                                                              \t|\r\n|-------------------\t|-------------------\t|----------------------\t|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| chat_id           \t| Integer or String \t| No (see description) \t| Required if inline_message_id is not specified.

Once reached this limit, files will not be sent if there's an unprocessed message from a user that isn't @pwrtelegramapi in front of the message queue (this limitation is only present if you use getupdates).  \r\n\r\n* You can use both getupdates and webhooks to get updates\r\n\r\nOnly remember that you will have to repeat the setwebhook request to enable proxying trough the PWRTelegram API.\r\n\r\n* answerInlineQuery\r\n\r\nThe usage if this method is exactly the same as in the official telegram bot api, except that you can provide URLs to files bigger than 5 megabytes and you can set the file type to ```file``` to enable automatical type and metadata recognition.\r\n\r\nYou can also upload files using via POST: you just have to upload the files with parameter name equal to ```inline_file0``` where 0 is the number of the file. The number has to be equal to the array index of the InlineQueryResult that will feature that file. The type_url field of that InlineQueryResult must also be empty.\r\n\r\nPlease note that it's better to upload the big files using the upload methods and store the file ids instead of uploading them directly using the answerInlineQuery method.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* Please note that this API is still in beta and there might be small bugs.
